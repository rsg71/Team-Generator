## Description

This team profile generator walks the user through a command line interface to generate team members on an html page. Users will enter a name, id, and email for all employees but will specialize the information depending on the type of employee (manager, engineer, or intern). Managers have an office number, engineers have a github username, and interns have a school. Once the user has completed filling out all information for their employees, they opt to not enter any more information and ultimately generate the team profile page as an html file.
